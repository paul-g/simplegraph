simplegraph
===========

simplegraph is a simple Swing application for plotting function graphs.
I was just learning Java at the time I wrote this so the code is messy 
and there are a few bugs, but this is set to change :)

In the meantime you can build & run it with (maven 3 is required):
`mvn package
java -jar target/simplegraph-${version}.jar`
